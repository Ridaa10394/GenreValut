# GenreVault - A Multi-Genre Book Organizer

## 📖 Project Overview

GenreVault is a web-based library management system that allows users to search for books, categorize them into different reading statuses, and maintain separate collections for different genres. Each genre has its own dedicated page and local storage, ensuring books added in one genre do not overlap with others.

- **Google Books API Integration**: Search for books by title or genre.
- **Categorization**: Organize books into "Want to Read," "Reading," and "Completed."
- **Persistent Storage**: Each genre has independent local storage.
- **Remove Functionality**: Remove books from specific categories without affecting other genres.
